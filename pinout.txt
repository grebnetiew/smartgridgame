The Display is connected to the first few digital and analog pins.
A set of headers is needed for this, as you need the 3.3V pin.

Connect digital pins 14--27 to the buttons. Pin 14 and 15 go with the first link, etc.
The other pins are for LEDs. Groups of five go to the cities, then three to the
power plant, then three to the dam.

Currently, some analog pins are used for a pair of buttons. This is a temporary measure
to compensate for a wiring difficulty, and should be reverted soon.

The cities are numbered in reading order, left to right then top to bottom. Links likewise.
